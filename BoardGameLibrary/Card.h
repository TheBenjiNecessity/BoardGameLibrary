/*
 * Purpose:
 * - A parent class for any card objects used in a game.
 * Notes:
 * - This class only supports the basics for cards.
 * - A card is not necessarily a specific kind of card like a classic playing
 *   card.
 * - This class represents a model containing information about a card.
 * - Any properties that have 'display' in the title should be used to display
 *   information to the user.
